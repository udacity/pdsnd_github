## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

As part of the udacity nanodegree programm "programming for data science" I created this project. This is my final solution for this part of this particullar nanodegree. 

This specific scriptis meant to analyze 3 different csv files with data from users.

This was the question that was given to attendees: 

"In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics."

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



### Prerequisites

What Software Do I Need?
To run this script, the following software requirements apply:

You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

I used pyhton 3.6.9 for this project. You can check for anaconda where you can modify real quick which python interpreter you want to use to switch between different pyhton versions. 
You also can go with gitpod.io to have 0 set up time and work directly in your browser which is my personal pick of the year. 

You also have to import pandas, numpy and time to run the script.

I also enjoyed using Pycharm in combination with anaconda

### Installing
