# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program - Project II


## Overview
we will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, the system will ask you three questions that is :
    - Which city would you like to filter by? New York City, Chicago or Washington?
    - Which month would you like to filter by? January, February, March, April, May, June or type 'all' if you do not have any preference?
    - Are you looking for a particular day? If so, kindly enter the day as follows: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or type 'all' if you do not have any preference?
then the system will give you answers for these list of question:
    - What month occurs most often in the start time?
    - What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
    - What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
    - What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
    - What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
    - What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
    - What are the counts of each user type?
    - What are the counts of gender?
    - What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?

## What Software Do you Need?
    - Python 
    - A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
    - A terminal application

## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
    - Start Time 
    - End Time 
    - Trip Duration 
    - Start Station 
    - End Station 
    - User Type 
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
    - Gender
    - Birth Year
