### Project Title
 **Bicycle-sharing systems**

### Description
Over the past decade, *bicycle-sharing systems* have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. *Bicycle-sharing systems* allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these *bike-sharing systems* are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—**Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
